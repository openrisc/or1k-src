			GDB simulator based on Or1ksim
			==============================

This is a GDB simulator, based on Or1ksim, the OpenRISC architectural
simulator. 

At present, this is a simple proof of concept, sufficient to allow regression
to be run against Or1ksim.

It does require the latest SVN build of Or1ksim, since it uses additional
library interface functions, which are not available in Or1ksim 0.4.0.
